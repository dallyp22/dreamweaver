Amid the renewed energy that the arrival of spring brings, make it a priority to slow your family's pace.

Carve out time in your days to linger outside together after winter's long indoor months. Take walks to admire the beauty of the season, planting your senses firmly in the present."

Talk about animals that live in or around lakes — fish, birds, and insects — as they snack. SLOWING DOWN IN SUMMER As the days lengthen and the sunbleached afternoons stretch into balmy evenings, summer offers families a chance to put the brakes on the constant push and pull of modern life. Away from the clamor and from calendar pages crammed with to-dos, hobbies take the place of hustle and children gain the freedom to follow their curiosity. In this slower pace, simple summer enjoyments grow into lasting memories—a homemade ice pop savored on the front steps or the spark of a firefly blinking in the night. The season invites us to experience present-moment living, to look around with wonder, and to savor laidback days with our loved ones."
