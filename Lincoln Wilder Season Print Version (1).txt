IN

SUMMER
As the days lengthen and the sunbleached afternoons stretch into balmy
evenings, summer offers families a chance
to put the brakes on the constant push and pull
of modern life. Away from the clamor and from
calendar pages crammed with to-dos, hobbies take
the place of hustle and children gain the freedom to
follow their curiosity.
In this slower pace, simple summer enjoyments
grow into lasting memories—a homemade ice pop
savored on the front steps or the spark of a firefly
blinking in the night. The season invites us to
experience present-moment living, to look
around with wonder, and to savor laidback days with our loved ones.
