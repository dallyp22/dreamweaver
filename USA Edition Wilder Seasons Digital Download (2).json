Amid the renewed energy that the arrival of spring brings, make it a priority to slow your family's pace. Notice the tender buds emerging on trees, blossoms unfolding into flowers, and the chorus of birdsong filling the air. Carve out time in your days to linger outside together after winter's long indoor months. Take walks to admire the beauty of the season, planting your senses firmly in the present."
