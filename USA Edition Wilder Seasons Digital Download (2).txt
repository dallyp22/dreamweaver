savor the transition from the end of summer
to the calming coolness of the fall season. As
families, we can turn our attention from the
hustle and bustle of daily events to the
natural world and its changes. Through this

½ cup brown sugar
⅓ cup molasses
1 egg
Optional: icing or sprinkles for
decorating

2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon cinnamon
¼ teaspoon cloves

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and spices. In
another bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Add egg and molasses
